# Examining Nutritional Quality of Meals On a Swiss Digital Nutrition Cohort

## Introduction
### Context & Motivation

Micronutrient adequacy is a cornerstone of dietary quality yet large-scale nutrition studies focus primarily on energy intake or macronutrient composition. In realty, under- or over- consumption of specific micronutrients (such as vitamins or minerals) can have effects on health and may vary systematically by food choice intake, meal timing and day of week.

In research of the diet quality, we impletent three complementary indices for each food item and composite meal :

1. **Qualifying Index QI** : Ratio of each qualifying nutrient contained in 2000 kcal of a given food relative to its Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value
2. **Disqualifying Index DI** : Ratio of each disqualifying nutrient contained in 2000 kcal of a given food relative to its Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) value
3. **Nutrient Balance NB** : Score of the extent to which a food, meal or diet can satisfy the daily requirements for all qualifying nutrient in a sample containing 2000 kcal


### Aims & Questions
- How do QI, DI and NB vary across major food groups and meal types?
- Do composite meal scores differ systematically between weekdays and weekend, indicating shofts in diet quality by day of week?
- Which individual micronutrients exert the greatest impact on QI and DI?
